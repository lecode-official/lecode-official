# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is David. I'm a research scientist at Fraunhofer HHI, where I focus on developing efficient machine learning solutions. My research interests involve federated learning, recommender systems, neural network compression, and explainable AI, with a particular focus on developing novel techniques and algorithms.

I have a strong foundation in computer science, having completed my M.Sc. degree from Technical University of Berlin in 2019. Prior to joining the research community, I worked as a software engineer on large-scale projects for various industries.

In addition to machine learning, I'm interested in formal languages, automata, and compiler construction â€“ topics that underpin many modern software systems. As someone with entrepreneurial experience, I value innovation and collaboration in driving technical solutions.

I'm currently pursuing my PhD while working on developing federated learning methods highly personalized and privacy-focused recommender systems.
